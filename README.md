# ft_containers

The standard C++ containers have all a specific usage. To make sure we understand them, I had to re-implement them!

Which containers I re-implemented:

-vector: without vector<bool> specialization.

-map.

-stack: It uses my vector class as default underlying container. But it still is compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.

-set.

Conatiners map and set I implemented by using Red Black Tree.
